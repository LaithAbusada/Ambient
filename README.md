# Ambient Video Player with Dynamic Gradient Background

## Objective

Create a **React application** that provides an immersive video-watching experience by dynamically generating an ambient light effect around the video player. The gradient background changes according to the colors in 4 quadrants of the video, enhancing the visual experience.

## Core Features

- **Dynamic Gradient Background**: Extract colors from the video in real-time to create a gradient that simulates ambient light around the video player.
- **Smooth Color Transition**: Implement smooth transitions between gradient colors as the video plays.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the video player and gradient effect are fully responsive and look great on all devices.
- **Custom Video Integration**: Easily replace the sample video with any MP4 file to see the effect in action with your content.
- **Canvas API Usage**: Utilize the Canvas API to process video frames and extract color data for the gradient.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LaithAbusada/Ambient.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Ambient
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:

   ```

## Usage

-  Watch the current video or Replace the default video file in the `public/videos/` directory with your video.
